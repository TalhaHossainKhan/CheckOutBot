# Overview

This personal project stemmed from the challenge of securing limited-edition Stussy hoodies during release day. I developed a checkout bot using PuppeteerJS and NodeJS to automate the purchase process on the Stussy website. The bot emulates human behavior to navigate the site, select items, and complete transactions.

### Key features:

+ Headless browser automation
+ Strategic delays and randomized actions
+ Robust error handling

This project deepened my understanding of web automation techniques and e-commerce systems, which I used in my sentiment analysis project.
